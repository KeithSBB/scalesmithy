<p><h1>Scale Smithy</h1> A graphical tool for looking at musical scales</p>
<p><h2>Features include:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Work and display scales on a chromatic circle</li>
    <li>Save and load scale families</li>
    <li>Enter notes and find the scale Family, mode and key</li>
    <li>Edit scale families, create new ones</li>
    <li>Select the scale family, mode and key</li>
    <li>Set a scale as a reference</li>
    <li>Play scale in various patterns to midi</li>
</ul></p>

<p><h2>What is a scale</h2></p>
<p>A scale is a selected set of tones.  In western music there are twelve tones in an octave.
A scale is typically a subset of tones that repeats in an octave, However a scale could span more than one octave.
Scale Smithy currently only works for single octave scales.  A two octave scale may be simulated by using the
    <i>Reference Scale</i> feature.  When viewed on a chromatic circle, a scale inscribes out a polygon with one vertex
positioned at the <i>root</i> position.   The polygon shape actually defines a scale family and positioning
each vertex at the root position are the different modes of that scale family.  The key is the note at the root position.
The diatonic scale Family, which has seven tones in an octave has seven modes.  Each mode may begin with any one
of the twelve notes.  Thus the Diatonic scale family defines 7 modes X 12 notes which is 84 differnt scales</p>
