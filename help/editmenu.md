root).  It then searches through all current scale familes and returns
the scale family and mode if a match is found.

## Scale Family Editor
This is a two step menu item.  The first time you click on it a dialog 
will ask you if you want to start with the current primary scale notes
or not.   Dismiss the dialog with OK puts the application into scale
edit mode where you can select or deselect tones in the first mode
of a new scale family.   Selecting the menu item a second time will
present a different dialog that accepts the name of the new scale
family and the names of each of the modes.  This will add the new
scale family to the internal list of scale families and it will be
saved to the configuration file.

## Delete Scale Family
This menu item will delete the current primary scale family.

## Restore Default Scale Families
This menu item will restore the original set of scale fmailies to
the Scale Smithy application.  You have the option of merging 
with any custom scale families, or replacing everything with just
the original default set
