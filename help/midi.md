# MIDI
## Play to port 
Using the current midi settings the primary scale will be played as
MIDI notes to a MIDI output port.  This is useful to hear new scales.
Any MIDI instrument can be used and fluidsynth (Qsynth) works well.

## MIDI Settings
A Dialog is presented that allows for the setting of:
* MIDI output port  (refresh button updates availble ports)
* MIDI Program Change (Instrument)
* Number of Octaves to play ( 1 or 2)
* Tempo in beats per minute
* Pattern(s) to play
