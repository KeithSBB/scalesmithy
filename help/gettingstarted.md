# Getting Started
Select a scale family, mode and key to define a scale to be displayed
on the chromatic circle.  The circle displays twelve tones in a octave
repeating scale. The polygon inscribed in the circle is the primary 
scale with each vertex a scale degree starting from the root position. 

Chords that align with the scale are displayed within each vertex. 
The preferences may be used to control to what level of chord 
complexity is shown.

You can set the primary scle to be a reference scale which is drawn in
red within the primar scale.  Changing the primary scale and compare it
with the reference scale.  This is useful to see what notes align between
the two scales and what chord changes would take place.  You can use this
feature to analize modal changes, key changes and/or completely different 
scales.

If you have a midi instrument configured (fluidsynth 0r QSynth) then
the scale can be played in selected patterns over one or two octaves
vis the MIDI menu.

You can also use this application to find a matching scale by inputting
the notes of a melody, or create new scales (currently limited to 
single octave).  See the Edit menu for details.

Scales can be printed, saved or loaded from json files or the application
image copied to the clipboard.  See File and Edit menus.
