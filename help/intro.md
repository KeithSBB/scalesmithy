# Introduction
I wrote this application to aid me in compositions for the bayan, a
Russian button accordion.  Since the bayan is a chromatic instrument
on the treble (right) side,  looking at scales from a chromatic perspective
seemed to fit very well.  I gained a better understanding of them and I've
found the reference scale, and chords at each scale degree valuable
when composing pieces for the bayan.  


## What is a scale

A scale is a selected set of tones.  In western music there are twelve tones in an octave.
A scale is typically a subset of tones that repeats in an octave, However a scale could span more than one octave.
Scale Smithy currently only works for single octave scales.  A two octave scale may be simulated by using the
    *Reference Scale* feature.  When viewed on a chromatic circle, a scale inscribes out a polygon with one vertex
positioned at the *root* position.   The polygon shape actually defines a scale family and positioning
each vertex at the root position are the different modes of that scale family.  The key is the note at the root position.
The diatonic scale Family, which has seven tones in an octave has seven modes.  Each mode may begin with any one
of the twelve notes.  Thus, the Diatonic scale family defines 7 modes X 12 notes which is 84 different scales.
